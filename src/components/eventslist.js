        'desc': "ABURobocon stands as a prominent international robotics competition in the Asia-Pacific region, characterised by its challenging four-stage structure: documentation, video submission, national round, and international round. NITW has been an active participant in Robocon for three consecutive years, starting from 2021.\n\nIn the year 2023 of stage 1, our team achieved an exceptional score of 95/100, placing them on par with the esteemed IIT, Delhi. The team, under the astute leadership of Santhosh (Additional Secretary, MED), undertook the responsibility of CAD designs, overseeing team management, and task allocation. Commencing work on January 9th, 2023, the team diligently finalized concrete robot designs within a mere two weeks, demonstrating remarkable efficiency in completing the necessary mechanical designs.\n\nThe meticulous documentation of mechanisms and designs was orchestrated by Sanaka Banerjee (Joint Secretary, MED), whose direction led to the creation of the finest design detail document in the history of NITW's Robocon teams.\n\nThe unwavering support and guidance from our Faculty Advisor played a pivotal role in the team's success. Their provision of essential resources and invaluable guidance for stage 2 were instrumental. Collaborating seamlessly, Santhosh, the Faculty Advisor, and Aaditya (General Secretary, ECE) synergized efforts to bring the Elephant Robot (ER) to fruition. Santhosh's sheer tenacity and commitment were evident, dedicating 4-5 hours daily from his schedule for the competition. The second-year students showcased remarkable dedication, balancing their exam commitments with their contributions to the competition. Aaditya's relentless efforts were pivotal in preparing the robot for the rigorous video submission.\n\nGratitude is owed to Mr. Yellaswamy and the technical staff at the workshop for their unwavering support. Additionally, the team acknowledges the invaluable contribution of Dr. Maheshwaram Satish (previous Faculty Advisor), whose meticulous scrutiny and constructive feedback throughout the manufacturing process were immensely beneficial.\nNITW's journey in ABURobocon is a testament to the collaborative spirit, dedication, and unwavering support from faculty and staff, setting a benchmark for future endeavours in the realm of robotics competitions."

        <b>Line Follower</b>
        The competition was held on 17th December,2022 from 9am-12am in TLC by Gurkirat Singh and Diya Kevat. Our Faculty Advisor along with the General Secretary Shaikh Abdullah came to pay a visit to see how the competition was going on.\n
        Line follower bot is a simple autonomously guided robot that follows a line drawn on the ground to either detect a dark line on a white surface or a white line on a dark surface. Participants had to build a line follower robot and the team with the best bots would get cash prizes accordingly. A 8x8 foot maze with a white line on a dark surface was printed for the event. It consisted of a few tricky parts. The robot could find itself in a loop, if the code didn’t have algorithms to tackle the loops.\n
        The judging criteria was based on the:\n
        ●  Accuracy\n
        If the robot completes the maze or not, if it gets stuck in loops or not, how well it follows a zig zagged path and curved turns\n
        ●	Time\n
        In how much time the robot can complete the maze and reach the end point\n
        A robot for demonstration was built by Gurkirat Singh using Arduino, two-IR sensors, two motors to power two wheels, and a battery. The robot worked well in mid-air, but due to the lack of sufficient power supply, it couldn’t work on the ground.\n
        One participant named Pratyush Raj Sharma built a fairly decent robot. He built it using Arduino, 2 IR sensors, 4 motors to power 4 wheels, and battery to power the bot. He was facing some issues initially but after working on it for 20 minutes more, he executed his robot in mid-air. Due to lack of sufficient power supply, it didn’t work on the ground. His enthusiasm and passion for robots could clearly be noticed in the bot he built and his efforts definitely paid off.\n

Following this, the winners were provided with a unique opportunity to build a gesture-controlled car under the guidance of Samar Jain, the Head of the Event. This task was facilitated by other RC members including Kevin, Varshitha, Bhagat, Arrhan, and Ayush. The gesture-controlled car featured a HC-05 Bluetooth module for seamless phone connectivity and an Arduino microcontroller. It was equipped with two L293D motor-driven rear wheels and a castor wheel.\n\nThe event was deemed successful as participants gained hands-on knowledge sparking a sustained passion for exploration among the participants in the process of creating a gesture-controlled car."
